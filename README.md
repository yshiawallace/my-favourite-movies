# My Favourite Movies Website

## Description
This program generates an HTML web page of my favourite movies, along with their trailers, the general info about the film and my random thoughts. The data used to generate the page comes from a csv file that I created and that I will continue to add to.

This is the first project that I have completed for the [Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

## Getting Started
Download a copy of the files:
- `entertainment_centre.py`
- `fresh_tomatoes.py`
- `media.py`
- `my-favourite-movies.csv`

## Instructions
1. Check if Python 2.7 is installed on your computer
2. If it is not installed, [install Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Run 'entertainment_centre.py' in the command line, like so: 
```python /path/to/entertainment_centre.py```
(replace `/path/to/` with the file path to your downloaded copy of `entertainment_centre.py`)

## Customization Instructions

Note: Follow these instructons to create your own favourite movies website

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 from 'Intructions' above
2. Add your own movie data (movie title, year, summary, coments, URL to poster image, and youtube trailer URL) to `my-favourite-movies.csv`. Make sure you do not alter the names of each column. You can add as many movies as you like.
3. Open `fresh_tomatoes.py` and search for these lines of code: 
```
<title>Yshia's Favourite Movies Website</title>
.
.
.
 <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Yshia'a Favourite Movies</a>
```
Update my name (Yshia) with your name.
4. Run 'entertainment_centre.py' in the command line, like so: 
```python /path/to/entertainment_centre.py```
(replace `/path/to/` with the file path to your downloaded copy of `entertainment_centre.py`)
