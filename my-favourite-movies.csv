Carol,2015,An aspiring photographer develops an intimate relationship with an older woman in 1950s New York.,"Ugh, don't even get me started with this movie. Besides being one of the few lesbian movies where both ladies are alive at the end (ie not punished for being deviant), it looks gorgeous. The cinematographer, Ed Lachman, used super 16mm film in reference to the photography of the period. There is a dark richness and a textural quality that seems to obscure your view, but the effect only makes you look deeper into the compositions so that your interaction with the frame has the same searching quality as a lover's gaze. There's plenty of gazing in this film. It's the lesbian 'Brokeback Mountain'.",http://cdn.playbuzz.com/cdn/e45349d9-a263-48e9-9966-1cc2a9a80ca6/14080bae-709a-47b8-9902-e318381f4e48.jpg,https://youtu.be/679wr31SXWk
Children of Men,2006,"In 2027, in a chaotic world in which women have become somehow infertile, a former activist agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman to a sanctuary at sea.","This movie depicts a dystopic not-so-distant future that looks a lot like where our world might be heading today, so the stakes in this film feel real. The pace is relentless from the beginning. You inhabit Clive Owen's POV for most of the film and you feel the vulnerability of his large, lumbering form as he propels himself into the unknown fueled by one last drop of hope.",http://www.upperleftedge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ChildrenofMen01.jpg,https://youtu.be/4pEV0iia1Lg
Death Proof,2007,Two separate sets of voluptuous women are stalked at different times by a scarred stuntman who uses his 'death proof' cars to execute his murderous plans.,"This is one long extended car chase in which a maniacally predatory man hunts and torments women, using his stunt car as his weapon. But then the tables turn and the hunter becomes the hunted. This was the film that solidified my appreciation of Quentin Tarantino because of the way he subverts historical and social narratives of victims and victimizers.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71t73NDu29L._SY550_.jpg,https://youtu.be/E_zP98RlIpQ
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,2004,"When their relationship turns sour, a couple undergoes a procedure to have each other erased from their memories. But it is only through the process of loss that they discover what they had to begin with.","A low-tech science-fiction, magic-realist love story. This film was the first time I had seen a realistic depiction of love on screen. Kaufman captures moments in a relationship (and the chemical reactions that happen between people) that are completely devoid of stereotype and formula. I don't know how he does it.",http://horrornews.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Eternal-Sunshine-poster.jpg,https://youtu.be/0zFywiAh7N0
Fargo,1996,Jerry Lundegaard's inept crime falls apart due to his and his henchmen's bungling and the persistent police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gunderson.,"This movie is a darkly hilarious, genius masterpiece by the Cohen brothers. A story of idiocy, greed, psychopathy, unfolds like a slow motion car crash. And juxtaposed with the anti-hero's collapse is the sincerity and practicality of the hero, Marge Gunderson.",http://la-screenwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/936full-fargo-poster.jpg,https://youtu.be/pz8pW_PAivc
In the Mood for Love,2001,A middle-aged woman finds herself in the middle of a huge conflict that will either make her a profit or cost her life.,"This movie will put you in a trance with its slow moving shots, winding staircases, glances through windows, doorways and cigarette smoke. This is THE most beautiful film ever made. Each frame is a painting. It is a sensory tapestry woven around an unrequited love story. Classy.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51626KRF46L.jpg,https://youtu.be/I2rzeq4V00k
Jackie Brown,1997,A middle-aged woman finds herself in the middle of a huge conflict that will either make her a profit or cost her life.,"I am obsessed with this movie, especially the music. The rhythm of the dialogue and the music is contrapuntal. Jackie is a proud black woman who is not going to let any of the men around her determine her fate. She plays them off each other to outwit them all. Go Jackie Brown, go.",http://www.goldenglobes.com/sites/default/files/films/jackie_brown.jpg,https://youtu.be/J9Bd4ShuEAw
Princess Mononoke,1999,"On a journey to find the cure for a Tatarigami's curse, Ashitaka finds himself in the middle of a war between the forest gods and Tatara, a mining colony. In this quest he also meets San, the Mononoke Hime.","This is a painfully beautiful epic fable. Besides the visual mastery, the most striking element of the narrative is its nuanced approach to the heroic trope. Unlike most stories about a questing hero, there is no 'bad-guy' or evil force to be vanquished. Instead the the conflicting interests of the characters are given equal consideration. This film reflects the complexity of our relationship with nature.",https://www.mauvais-genres.com/18507/princess-mononoke-japanese-movie-poster-style-c-20x28-in-1997-studios-ghibli-miyazaki.jpg,https://youtu.be/YOuG8m2RqOs
The Descent,2005,"A caving expedition goes horribly wrong, as the explorers become trapped and ultimately pursued by a strange breed of predators.","I never liked horror movies until I watched The Descent. It combines all the horror ingredients that I love: monsters, a bit (a lot) of gore and psychological terror. Oh, and small underground spaces. I won't say more.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NzQ1NTgwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjUxMzUzMw@@._V1_UY1200_CR90,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg",https://youtu.be/4mujk825LXk
